  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Allow from_port, to_port to be specified on group authorizations,
    while not breaking old code.
  * Corrected a misspelled method name.  Fixes issue 36 on github.com

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Updated EC2 API to version 2010-07-01, all methods should be
    backwards compatible. elbadmin script now has two new functions:
    addl: Adds a new listener to an existing ELB  rml: Removes an
    existing listener from an ELB

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Changed S3Connection.get_all_buckets() to pass optional headers

  * Updating the sphinx documentation templates to include route53 and
    multipart stuff for s3.
  * Adding gs and file modules to Sphinx documentation templates.
  * Forgot to add boto.route53 to list of modules.

  [ rlotun ]
  * Added .gitignore. Skip .pyc and vim .swp files.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * AWS is offended by the white space preceding <?xml.  Also removed
    debug output.
  * Okay, this commit really does turn off the debug output.
  * Updated README file with route53.

  [ Barnaby Gray ]
  * Small fixes for route53

  [ James Dennis ]
  * QuestionForm instance as question keyword was not handled correctly

  [ Barnaby Gray ]
  * Fix slip up in my fixes

  [ Dmitry Konishchev ]
  * Added support for NoDevice in RunInstances's block device mapping

  [ rlotun ]
  * Support for CloudWatch 2010-08-01 The major addition is the ability
    to create alarms on metrics and have them perform actions when they
    pass certain defined thresholds (currently this is limited to SNS
    notifications). Other minor changes include the automatic conversion
    of Timestamp types to python `datetime.datetime` objects.

  [ Barnaby Gray ]
  * Add support for paginating get_all_rrsets

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Added some info to docstrings.  Fixed some formatting issues.

  [ rlotun ]
  * Implementing remaining API calls in ELB. Adds support for creating
    and deleting stickiness policies, and setting SSL certificate IDs on
    lb listeners.
  * Beginning of autoscale 2010-08-01 support. This includes the
    deprecation of triggers, and the enabling of scheduled actions and
    policies.

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Mods so if BOTO_CONFIG environment variable is set we only load that
    config file, rather than loading merge of config locations.

  [ rlotun ]
  * More work on implementing autoscale calls. Added support for getting
    and setting policies and metric collection types as well as a few
    bugfixes.

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Current state of pluggable auth: integrated into boto/connection.py;
    still needs to be integrated into other parts of boto

  [ Alexey Komissarouk ]
  * Added the 'number hits approved' and 'adult' requirements to mturk
    qualifications.  Descriptions and codes taken from
    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSMturkAPI/2008-08-
    02/index.html?ApiReference_QualificationRequirementDataStructureArti
    cle.html -AMK

  [ Jason R. Coombs ]
  * Added test to do a simple caller instruction (fails due to signature
    version)
  * FPSConnection now uses SignatureVersion 2 (now required by Amazon).

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixed a bug and added support for QSA for S3.
  * Slight refactoring to make it easier to remove other uses of
    self.hmac.

  [ Greg Taylor ]
  * Add the consistent_read kwarg to sdb.Domain.get_item() and added a
    Sphinxd docstring.
  * gs.rst incorrectly referenced boto.gs.resumable_download_handler
    instead of boto.gs.resumable_upload_handler. Fixed.
  * Fixing header underlines to be the correct length.
  * Looks like in file.rst, boto.file.bucketlistresultset was re-named
    to boto.file.simpleresultset but never updated in the docs. Fixed.
  * Minor typo.
  * More underline headline fixes.
  * Tracked down a really mis-leading REST warning.
  * Found another tricky REST docstring issue.
  * Finally figured out the rest of the REST errors in docstrings. Fixed
    those, along with some formatting, spelling, and some tags that look
    like they were left over from an old doc system.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixing up remaining references to hmac.

  [ MaximVeksler ]
  * Make fetch_file consider username & password when accessing S3

  [ Maxim Veksler ]
  * Allow ShellCommand to throw Exception on shell command failue

  [ garnaat ]
  * Merge branches 'gtaylor-sdb_get_item_consist_read' and 'master'

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Add the ability to specify the working directory for a command to be
    run, and use that to do git version updates for boto in the
    bootstrap code.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Reworking the auth handlers so they are selected based on capability
    rather than other, more arbitrary criteria.
  * Got route53 authentication working with plugin mechanism.

  [ Seth Golub ]
  * Added notify_workers to mturk.connection, to support sending
    messages to Mechanical Turk workers.

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Fixed cfadmin to work with new S3Origin stuff

  [ Greg Taylor ]
  * Fix a 2-space indent.
  * The SQS intro mentions sqs.queue.dump(), but in sqs.queue, it's
    actually called dump_(), as per issue #40. This would be a highly
    unusual method name, so I'm assuming this should be dump(), like the
    tutorial says. This fix makes the module match the tutorial.
  * Removed time.sleep() in favor of using the consistent_read keyword
    on all queries. Brought the test runtime down to 4.5 seconds from 45
    seconds on my faster internet connection. Should also eradicate any
    chance of the 10 second sleeps time not being long enough (as
    unlikely as it may be).
  * Start picking up docstrings on constructors. I see we have
    docstrings for some constructors, but the previous config didn't
    allow for them to be displayed. This should be a barely visible
    change, but should add some extra documentation that was previously
    hidden.
  * Lots and lots of SDB documentation. The sdb module API docs are now
    reasonably descriptive. We're not done yet, though.
  * Made the following methods on boto.sdb.connection.SDBConnection
    private: * build_name_value_list * build_expected_value *
    build_batch_list * build_name_list
  * Documented SDBConnection.set_item_cls()

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Add missing argument specification for cwd argument.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Lots of small changes to accomodate plug-in authentication
    mechanism.  Still on branch for now.

  [ moranski ]
  * Changed statistic name "Samples" to "SampleCount".

  [ garnaat ]
  * Manually incorporating small change from pull request 67.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Few more tweaks to pluggable auth branch.
  * Adding sdb to list of capabilities.
  * Adding the canonical names of each of the auth handlers to list of
    capabilities.
  * Fixing a bug in HmacKey regarding resolution of credentials.

  [ garnaat ]
  * Fixed a typo bug in Instance class.  Fixes issue 487.
  * Adding a few missing attributes to the Image object.

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Starting to add some wrapper XML objects for Route53. It's now easy
    to add a Resource Record, simply create a new ResourceRecordSets
    object (from boto.route53.record), passing in a connection and the
    Zone ID:   changes = ResourceRecordSets(conn, hosted_zone_id,
    optional_comment) Then add any changes you want:   record =
    changes.add_change("CREATE", "foo.example.com.", "CNAME") And don't
    forget to set the values for this new record, in this case where the
    foo.example.com. CNAME points to:   record.add_value("my-load-
    balancer.elb.amazonaws.com") You can add multiple values by
    continuing to call "add_value":   record.add_value("my-second-
    lb.elb.amazonaws.com") Once you're done, commit the changes:
    changes.commit()

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Correct the order that the device name and the mount point are
    written out to the fstab file.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixing the handling of auth_path in HmacAuthV1Handler.  Cleaning up
    a bit in cloudfront.

  [ Dmitry Konishchev ]
  * POST is enabled for ModifyInstanceAttribute because userData can be
    too long for GET

  [ garnaat ]
  * Making ELBConnection region-aware
  * Adding section in S3 tutorial explaining locations.  Also added the
    ap-southeast-1 location to the Location object in
    boto.s3.connection.
  * Fixing a formatting typo in the S3 tutorial.

  [ Dmitry Konishchev ]
  * Fixed a bug due to which EC2Connection.allocate_address() always
    throwed an exception

  [ garnaat ]
  * Add a check for part number<1 because we love to start counting at
    zero, don't we?

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Fix for recent pluggable auth mods, for case where requests go
    through a proxy

  [ garnaat ]
  * Adding the SetInstanceHealth request.  Untested at this point.

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Fixes for various pluggable auth problems: 1) incorrect path rewrite
    when accessing storage via a proxy. 2) incorrent call signature to
    AWSAuthConnection.build_base_http_request from from resumable upload
    handler. 3) missing auth_path parameter, which resulted in various
    split attempts on "NoneType" failures.

  [ Ian Kallen ]
  * corrected doc string for update_group (it doesn't look like it
    adds/removes)

  [ Seth Golub ]
  * Added methods for some operations: create_qualification_type
    update_qualification_type get_qualification_type
    assign_qualification

  [ Jerome Petazzoni ]
  * Add support for HTTPS ELBs (SSL done at the ELB)

  [ Keith Fitzgerald ]
  * ignore egg-info output
  * upgrade to use now required version 2 signature
  * transaction amount required for URL

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixed a typo bug in get_all_subnets method's contruction of params.
    See github issue #6.
  * Making the construction of the glob pattern more friendly to non-
    posix environments.

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Updated SDB manager to allow for itemName() checks

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Use the configured boto location when doing a git pull in the
    bootstrap code.
  * Deal with attachment failures, and log where all volumes in the
    system as well as where they're currently mounted.
  * Syntax correction.
  * Halt the processing of all startup scripts if a script raises an
    exception.
  * Add the rest of the missing lines that occured through a series of
    cut and paste errors.
  * Fixed indent problem.

  [ unknown ]
  * Signed-off-by: unknown <Dudemeister@.(none)>Added methods for mturk
    operations: dispose_qualification_type search_qualification_types,
    get_qualification_requests, grant_qualification,
    revoke_qualification. Created data structures for
    QualificationRequest QualificationType (based on
    BaseAutoResultElement). Hooked those classes to the methods which
    were created. Also modified create_qualification_type
    update_qualification_type get_qualification_type
    assign_qualification to return the appropriate data structures
    (instead of just an empty resultset with attributes all over the
    place). Slight change to mturk/qualification.py to make sure
    'IntegerValue' is not present when comparator is 'Exists'.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Adding support for S3 response headers.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Remove the recording and checking of the ec2.attach_volume call. The
    call will either return a good status (attaching or attached) or
    will throw an exception, so there's no need to check the return
    value. Change the time delay on checing the mount status to two
    seconds.

  [ garnaat ]
  * Fixes issue 489.  Also cleaned up some docstrings and other PEP8
    stuff.

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Allow "__id__" to be used instead of itemName() in queries

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Tag all snapshots with the name of the volume they're a snapshot of
    so we can keep track of the snapshots as a volume is swapped out for
    larger volumes.
  * Repeat the attach volume call if it fails with ec2 complaining that
    the currently running instance is not running.
  * Fix typo.

  [ Dmitry Konishchev ]
  * All EC2 requests has been changed from GET to POST It's necessary
    when you have a lot number of instances, volumes, snapshots, etc.,
    because in this case the request's body can be too long for GET.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Make /tmp world writable even if we didn't have to move the
    ephemeral store there.

  [ cariaso ]
  * prevents timezone errors

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Implemented support for adding Google Storage group-by-email grants.

  [ Stanislav Ievlev ]
  * Fixing work with unicode strings within EC2Connection class. All
    values will be correctly quoted in the lower level.

  [ Jakub Vysoky ]
  * fully long ip is 15 chars - but we want delim 192.168.192.168 is 15
    chars
  * show private ip option

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Updated Route53 connections to use the same XML parsing used
    elsewhere in boto for RRsets. This is a backwards incompatible
    change to the get_rrsets call in route53 connection, but it makes
    everything more consistent with the other modules. Also added a
    route53 command line client to make workging with Route53 a little
    easier.

  [ garnaat ]
  * First pass at a fix for problems with eucalyptus services caused by
    the pluggagle auth code.
  * A better fix for the auth problem.  Gets rid of the _server_name
    method in auth.py which really shouldn't have been there in the
    first place.  Assumes that the host attribute of the HTTPRequest
    object will have the correct host name already.
  * moving connection classes to connection.py files for consistency.

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Fixed boto.s3.Key class' call into resumable download handler (got
    broken during some of the pluggable auth refactoring)

  [ garnaat ]
  * Allow additional args to be passed to auth handlers, if desired.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Add the trim_snapshots() method to ec2/connection.py, and correct
    local object references in createSnapshot.

  [ Blake Maltby ]
  * Fixed typo in param name in set_lb_listener_SSL_certificate

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Added missing "help" function for the route53 command line script
  * Added paging support directly into the ResourceRecordSets object
  * Fixed up route53 command line script to include a delete method and
    properly print out zone info on creation

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Remove debugging code.

  [ Harry Marr ]
  * Initial SES connection class, SendEmail implemented
  * Added support for HTML emails via format param
  * Added support for sending raw messages
  * Covered other SES API methods
  * Added connect_ses shortcut function
  * Moved connection class to connection.py
  * Added SES package to setup.py
  * Refactor - private methods, docstrings

    parameter if the value was zero.
  * Bug fix: Event must not assume that AssignmentId is always present.
    (HITExpired events, for example, do not have this field.)
  * Added get_qualifications_for_qualification_type()

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Updated DateProperty to auto-convert from datetime

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Retry boto git pull commands in bootstrap up to 10 times before
    giving up.

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Removed Model.lookup method, leftovers from another time

  [ winhamwr ]
  * Fixed invalid list param in elb.describe_inestance_health

  * self.id should be assigned the invalidation request id and not the
    built-in method id()

  [ Gleicon Moraes ]
  * added a tentative get_website_endpoint to bucket to translate from
    location constraint to website endpoint

  [ Jon Colverson ]
  * Fixed the website endpoint hostnames. The method used the
    connection.host attribute as part of the name, which was
    "s3.amazonaws.com" whereas the website endpoint hostnames end with
    just "amazonaws.com" (without the "s3." bit):
    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteEndpoin
    ts.html#top
  * Removed references to update() arguments that no longer exist.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * A few small changes to website functionality in bucket.py.  Mainly
    cosmetic.

  [ Lucas Hrabovsky ]
  * Add support for account alias API calls.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Changing URL references to use a Google shortened URL to aid in code
    formatting.  Also reworked get_account_alias slightly to avoid going
    past column 80 for complicated statement.

  [ Roberto Gaiser ]
  * cloudwatch region endpoint changes

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Adding ability to pass in list of region names to get_all_regions.

  * Changed sequence to not auto-delete

  [ Roberto Gaiser ]
  * Auto Scaling Interface with connect_to_region

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * The Tag value should always be included in the params, even if the
    value is the empty string.
  * Trying to pretty up the README file a bit.
  * Renaming to .markdown.

  [ garnaat ]
  * Reorganizing the existing test code.  Part of a long-term project to
    completely revamp and improve boto tests.
  * Updating setup.py to include the new test locations.
  * monitor_instance and unmonitor_instance should really accept
    multiple instance IDs, not just one.  Add new capability without
    breaking old code.

  [ Roberto Gaiser ]
  * cloudwatch fix in progress
  * cloudwatch xml fix

  [ garnaat ]
  * Removing some debug print statements and commented lines.

  [ Keith Fitzgerald ]
  * do base64 encode userdata, amazon not accepting otherwise

  [ sanbornm ]
  * Added support for returnpath and reply-to addresses
  * Added docstring explanation for return_path and reply_addresses

  [ Stanislav Ievlev ]
  * force cast to ASCII string to avoid a double url encoding when
    bucket name is a unicode value (connection.py contains a code for
    urlencoding of unicode headers)

  [ Hinnerk ]
  * Added sdb.db.property.TimeProperty.

  [ Pierre Riteau ]
  * Fix typo in EMR request parameters: s/memeber/member/ Apparently AWS
    accepted requests with the typo, but the API documentation says it
    should be member.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixing a bug in new versions of monitor_instances and
    unmonitor_instances.  Variable param was not initialized.
  * Adding additional checking when attempting to complete a multipart
    upload.  Some errors are reported in the body of the response even
    though the HTTP response is 200.

  [ Steve Howard ]
  * Fix reduced redundancy support in multipart uploads In multipart
    uploads, the storage class is specified when initiating the upload,
    not when uploading individual parts.  See:
    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/index.html?mpU
    ploadInitiate.html
    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/index.html?mpU
    ploadUploadPart.html So add a reduced_redundancy kwarg to
    Bucket.initiate_multipart_upload() and remove it from
    MultiPartUpload.upload_part_from_file, ensuring that method does
    *not* specify reduced redundancy storage. Signed-off-by: Steve
    Howard <steve@thumbtack.com>

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Added some docstring info to the initiate_multipart_upload method.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Deal with possible race condition if snapshot trimming code is run
    on two different servers at the same time.
  * Add the configurable invocation of the tag based snapshot cleanup
    instead of the manage.Volume based snapshot cleanup. Defaults to the
    old manage.Volume based snapshot cleanup.
  * Correct typo.
  * Correct typo.

  [ garnaat ]
  * Fixing a typo bug in unmonitor_instances.

  [ Mike Schwartz ]

    CloudFront distributions.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixing a few small issues with the roboto Param class.

  [ Seth Golub ]
  * Allow NotifyWorkers to send to multiple worker IDs.  (API allows up
    to 100.)

  [ garnaat ]
  * bumping version number to 2.0b5.

  [ sanbornm ]
  * Fixed bug where send_raw_email required destinations addresses
    causing bcc header in raw message to be ignored

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Fixing so class variables always being with an upper case letter to
    avoid confusion.
  * Don't call process_args in constructor.  Fix reference to self.name.
  * Adding additional standard options.
  * Fixing reference to filters.
  * Combine standard options into an option group.
  * Fixing typo bug in boto.s3.acl.Policy
  * Incorporating a patch to handle obscure bug in apache/fastcgi.  See
    http://goo.gl/0Tdax.
  * Simplify the output formatting and allow the generic formattter to
    be easily overridden to customize output.
  * Add support for boolean params.  Make optparse options and args
    available on instance.
  * Removed the explicit Name class attribute.  Just use the name of the
    class itself.
  * Changing email address to one that actually works.
  * Add a file param type.  Fix issue with an empty Response attribute.
  * Add a RequiredParamError exception.
  * Fixed an issue with extra headers in generated URLs.  Fixes
    http://code.google.com/p/boto/issues/detail?id=499
  * Initialize self.default properly in constructor.
  * Incorporating a patch from AWS to allow security groups to be
    tagged.
  * CreateQualificationType request was using TestDuration as a param
    rather than TestDurationInSeconds.  Fixes github issue 142.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Sort the backup times before deleting snapshots to be sure the time
    order is correct between the timing of the first snapshot of the
    month and the timing of the snapshot from four weeks ago.
  * Rolled back the APIVersion for the ec2 connection so we get instance
    tags. For reasons yet unknown, the more current version
    specification causes the XML persing for get_all_instances to ignore
    anything between a close item tag (</item>) and the next open item
    tag. This causes the code not to process the tag information, so we
    don't get instance tags. This fix is a necessary temporary step for
    our use of boto. A permanent fix is obviously required so the
    interface version can be upgraded.

  [ Jann Kleen ]
  * fixed hostname mixup (subdomains were in wrong order)
  * autoscale connection now uses config options as defined in
    documentation

    caused an error
  * fixed bug in deletion of autoscaling_groups

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Added "expected_value" to all put method and all manager's
    "save_object" methods. Added "encode_string" and "decode_string" to
    make sure the string is unicode for SDB

  [ Michael Thompson ]
  * Improve formatting when printing zone records and listing commands
  * Add a change_record command to bin/route53
  * Setting max items doesn't correctly limit the records printed as the
    record set is truncated and the pagination feature results in an
    additional request to AWS to get the rest of the results.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Deal with the groupSet element that appears in the instanceSet
    element in the DescribeInstances response. In the 2011-01-01 ec2 API
    (which this commit also switches back to), there's a groupSet
    element within the instancesSet element. The groupSet element is not
    documented in http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2011-01-
    01/APIReference/, but it does appear in the examples on that page,
    and it is sent by Amazon. Without this change, the closing </item>
    tag within the groupSet tag within the instancesSet tag was
    interpreted by boto.handler.XmlHandler as the close item tag for the
    instance, which caused the returned instance not to have any of the
    data that appears later in the XML element, including the tags. This
    tag causes the SML processing to recognize the embedded groupSet tag
    and continue.

  [ garnaat ]

    names.
  * Adding support for enum param types.
  * Fixed a bug introduced in last commit.  The pythonize_name param was

    in the same messages. Backwards compatible

  [ garnaat ]
  * fixing small whitespace issues.

  [ Chris Moyer ]

    do object-y things.
  * Fixed last checkin, apparently I'm bad at git.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * In bootstrap, run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade if so
    configured.

  [ garnaat ]
  * Removing boto.sdb.persist module.  This is no longer supported and
    has been superceded by boto.sdb.db.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Correct test for running apt-get update / upgrade in bootstrap.py
  * Doh. Correct typo on boto.config
  * Move the apt-get update / upgrade stuff to startup.py where it will
    get run without new amis.

  [ Louis R. Marascio ]
  * accept metadata when initiating a multipart upload - an optional
    metadata dict may be provided, and if so will be merged with the
    request headers setting the metadata key/values on the resulting key
    from   the multipart upload

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Add missing import statement in the ebs installer.

  [ Mitch Garnaat ]
  * Incorporating patch from daviddpark to fix security group
    copy_to_region method.  See issue

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Removed HOME environment variable dependency in config handler,
    simplifying Windows installation.

  [ Pierre Riteau ]
  * Use the unversioned streaming jar symlink provided by EMR This makes
    streaming steps work with both 0.18 and 0.20 Hadoop versions.
    Without this fix streaming steps run by a jobflow with
    hadoop_version='0.20' fail.

  [ Jann Kleen ]

    for unused imports.

  [ Keith Fitzgerald ]
  * autoscale userdata needs to be base64 encoded.
  * we must POST autoscale user-data, not GET. otherwise a HTTP 505
    error is returned from AWS. see:
    http://groups.google.com/group/boto-
    dev/browse_thread/thread/d5eb79c97ea8eecf?pli=1

    invalidation, Also fixed tabs
  * BOTO_ENV should append to the config locations, not replace them

  [ Mike Schwartz ]
  * Mod to GS ACL class to make polymorphic ACL access somewhat easier.

  [ John Walsh ]
  * Remove the apt-get upgrade code. For reasons unknown, in Ubuntu
    10.04, if you have Tomcat installed, running apt-get upgrade from
    within the startup scripts starts Tomcat6, even if there are no
    tomcat startup script links in /etc/init.d/rc2.d. Apache is not
    started, only Tomcat. Rather than hacking something in to boto to
    shutdown Tomcat if it's running and shouldn't be, this operation
    will be handled outside of boto.

  [ rlotun ]
  * Fix parameters and docstrings for an Autoscale group.
  * Bugfix to healthcheck parameters and docstring fix.

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Updated boto.config to allow for BOTO_PATH, and to re-work how $HOME

    and old style as public methods.

  [ David Park ]
  * Support for ap-northeast-1 region Committer: David Park
    <daviddpark@gmail.com>

  [ Matt Singleton ]
  * _build_list_params() handles unicode strings too

  [ Louis R. Marascio ]
  * Specify a reasonable socket timeout for httplib - httplib uses an
    indefinite (or very, very large) timeout by default, meaning
    socket operations may take a very long time. Reasonable web requests
    should   have their sockets established within seconds. New
    connections created with   httplib can override this indefinite
    timeout by specifying a more reasonable   timeout in seconds. - This
    commit specifics a default timeout of 5 seconds for httplib socket
    operations. It also allows the overriding of this timeout by
    specifyin a   configuratio option, http_socket_timeout, in the Boto
    config file.
  * timeout now only applies to Python 2.6 and up - Check Python version
    in constructor and build a kwargs dict that will be   used to
    specify timeout if Python is 2.6 and above. - Python versions prior
    to 2.6 should see now change and continue to work.
  * timeout now retains legacy default behavior - if no timeout is
    specified in configuration, no timeout will be supplied to   httplib
    and the legacy default (infinite) will be used

  [ Greg Taylor ]
  * Fixing Sphinx warnings and errors. Warnings/errors in one module can
    lead to seemingly random warnings/errors in other modules, we should
    probably be more vigilant about not introducing new errors.

  [ garnaat ]
  * Merging doc changes and fixing a couple PEP8 issues.

  [ Jann Kleen ]
  * in python < 2.7, version_info is no named tuple

  [ Chris Moyer ]
  * Fixed the change that broke SDB, added comma before the new region
    info addition so SDB works again.
  * Fixed SQS region imports too
